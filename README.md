# Book.me

This is a personal project for the purpose of studying, applying concepts and making mistakes. There WILL be bad code, there WILL be horrible interfaces, you have been warned.

## What this is supposed to be

Mainly it is a tracker for books you lend to friends, with sprinkles of social networking
